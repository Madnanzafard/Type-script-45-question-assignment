/*Question 11: Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in an array called names.
Print each personâ€™s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

Explain & TIP: An array is like a list of items.
You can store multiple items, like your friends' names, in one variable and access them one by one.*/
var Names = ["Danish", "Haider", "Ali", "Sajid"];
for (var i = 0; i < Names.length; i++) {
    console.log(Names[i]);
