/*Question 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite?
Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner.
Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

Explain & TIP: Just like with transportation, you can use an array to manage a list of guests.
Loop through the list to send each one a personal invitation.*/
