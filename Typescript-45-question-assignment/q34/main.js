/*Question 34: Pizzas: Share your favorite pizzas and express your love for them.
Explain & TIP: Use a for loop to iterate over your pizza list, allowing you to express your preference for each type.
This demonstrates looping through an array and appending custom messages to each item.*/
var pizzas = ["Pepperoni", "Cheese", "Mushroom"];
for (var i = 0; i < pizzas.length; i++) {
    console.log("I like ".concat(pizzas[i], " pizza."));
}
console.log("I enjoy classic Margherita, with its simplicity and fresh flavors.");
console.log("Sometimes, a spicy pepperoni with extra cheese hits the spot just right.");
console.log("But nothing beats a loaded supreme with all the toppings for an indulgent treat.");
console.log("I really love pizza!");
